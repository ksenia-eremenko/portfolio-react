          <div className="title semibold b-title bt16">HTML + CSS(SASS, LESS)</div>
          <div className="b-title bt14 color3">I know how to work with user interfaces and create them. I work with semantic HTML tags. Working with CSS selectors and writing them. I understand the block model. I understand flexbox. <br />Working with and implementing responsive web principles, including proper use of media queries.</div>

          <div className="title semibold b-title bt16">JSX/TSX</div>
          <div className="b-title bt14 color3">In React, I work with a syntax extension that is truly one of the coolest parts of the React ecosystem: JSX and TSX. JSX is so similar to HTML that you can think of it as JavaScript with an HTML flavor. <br /> JSX is an abstraction on top of the React.createElement() API. One of the reasons it's vital for a library.</div>

          <div className="n b-title color3">03</div>
          <div className="title semibold b-title bt16">JavaScript</div>
          <div className="b-title bt14 color3">Understanding the fundamental concepts that the JavaScript language provides: -Variables and scoping; -Arrays and objects; -Array Methods; -Functions and arrow functions; -DOM Manipulation and event handlers; -The 'this' keyword; -Higher order functions and callback functions and more.</div>

          <div className="title semibold b-title bt16">Git</div>
          <div className="b-title bt14 color3">Git is essential for every developer to store projects in solutions like GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab. A skill that is part of my daily life.</div>

          <div className="n b-title color3">05</div>
          <div className="title semibold b-title bt16">Redux</div>
          <div className="b-title bt14 color3">Redux is a state management library and more. This is not a framework, but a self-confident way of working with data. The principles behind Redux are similar to functional programming and immutability. The key is to master the concepts of fundamental React programming before diving into Redux.</div>

          <div className="title semibold b-title bt16">Node + npm + yarn</div>
          <div className="b-title bt14 color3">React developers need to have a solid understanding of the npm registry. This is the place where software developers can go to get software to help them build software. Sounds funny, but truly thatâ€™s all the npm is: a cloud storage for packages we call dependencies.</div>
